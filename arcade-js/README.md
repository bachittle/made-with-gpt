This is an example of what not to do with GPT-4: let it program on its own

We have to remember that it is an autocompletion engine and is only predicting the next logical outcome. 
It doesn't understand that the code its writing has good structure, it just writes something that fits the requirements.

In this case, it came up with good names and the folder structure seemed good in theory...

But when it did actual coding, it made a big mess and nothing compiled correctly. 

Future improvements will be in arcade-js2. I will document the process more thoroughly and 
use the documentation to generate code, rather than just code.
