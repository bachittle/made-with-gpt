I want to make an arcade cabinet in javascript. It contains a bunch of simple arcade games that do not have any texture. 

Some examples of games that I will start with:
- pong.js
- breakout.js

Come up with some more arcade games for this cabinet. Invent your own as well as including clones of other games. Here are some classic arcade games and some original ideas for your arcade cabinet:

Classic games:
1. space_invaders.js - a Space Invaders clone
2. pacman.js - a Pac-Man clone
3. asteroids.js - an Asteroids clone
4. snake.js - a Snake clone
5. tetris.js - a Tetris clone
6. frogger.js - a Frogger clone

Original games:
1. reaction_racer.js - a simple racing game where players must quickly steer the car to avoid obstacles 
2. alien_lander.js - control a spaceship and land it smoothly on a platform by adjusting its position and velocity
3. heroic_hopper.js - a one-button game where the player must time their jumps to navigate platforms and avoid enemies
4. laser_defense.js - defend a base by shooting down descending enemy ships and projectiles
5. jump_n_dash.js - an endless runner where the player jumps, slides, and dashes to avoid obstacles and collect power-ups
6. shape_shifter.js - a puzzle game where players must rotate and match shapes to clear lines and advance levels

These games should provide a diverse selection for your arcade cabinet while maintaining the theme of simple graphics and gameplay.

Define a hierarchal folder structure that would be good for this project. Use markdown bullet lists (dashes) for the hierarchy.
Make the code structure only include breakout.js for now, but add the ability to add other games later.

```
- arcade_cabinet
    - assets
        - fonts
        - sounds
    - css
        - main.css
    - games
        - breakout.js
        - pong.js
        - space_invaders.js
        - pacman.js
        - asteroids.js
        - snake.js
        - tetris.js
        - frogger.js
        - reaction_racer.js
        - alien_lander.js
        - heroic_hopper.js
        - laser_defense.js
        - jump_n_dash.js
        - shape_shifter.js
    - js
        - main.js
        - game_framework.js
    - index.html
```

In this folder structure, the assets folder will contain any fonts and sounds that the games might need. The css folder will have the main stylesheet for the entire project. The games folder will hold all the individual game files including breakout.js and the others you plan to add later. The js folder will have the main.js file responsible for loading and managing the games, as well as a game_framework.js file which will have common utilities and functions that will be useful across different games. Finally, there will be an index.html file which serves as the main entry point for the project.

To make it easy to add games later, you can create a simple variable that stores the available games.

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Breakout",
        "file": "breakout.js"
    },
    {
        "name": "Pong",
        "file": "pong.js"
    }
]
```

In the main.js file, you can write code to load the list of games from the variable and dynamically create menu items for each game in the index.html file. When a user selects a game from the menu, main.js would load the corresponding JS file, create a new instance of the game class, and start the game loop.

Remember to include the following structure in your index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
    <title>Arcade Cabinet</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="gameContainer">
        <canvas id="gameCanvas"></canvas>
    </div>
    <div id="gameMenu">
        <!-- Dynamically populated menu items -->
    </div>
    <script src="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This way, it will be easy to add new games in the future. Just add their .js files to the games folder, and include their metadata in the games_config variable.

Does this design have any code smells? How can they be fixed?

This design is generally good and modular, making it easy to extend and maintain. However, there are a few potential areas for improvement:

2. All the game files are stored in the same folder, which can make it difficult to manage as the number of games grows. To keep things organized, it is a good idea to create a folder for each game within the games folder, and place the respective game's files (such as JS, images, sounds, etc.) in their corresponding folder.
(I will keep games in their own file for now, as I don't need images and sounds for most of these games. )

3. The game framework file (game_framework.js) may become hard to maintain if it grows too large with lots of utility functions and classes. To combat this issue, you can also create separate utility files within the js folder, like collision_detection.js or input_manager.js, and only include the necessary files in each game file. This would help in making the project more modular and easier to maintain.
(I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.)

4. Loading each game file individually may lead to increased load times, especially if there are a lot of games in the list. One potential solution for this is to concatenate and minify all the game files into a single bundled file, which would then be loaded by main.js. This will improve loading times and overall performance of your arcade cabinet project.
(Understood, will consider this for the future.)

By addressing these potential code smells, you can ensure that your project is easier to maintain, extend, and optimize.
