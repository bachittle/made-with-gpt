explain step-by-step how a developer should start writing this code?
indicate what functions should be written, how the functions should communicate with each other, etc.

This is what I have so far, please expand upon what I have.

First we make the frontend and get a blank design set up for the arcade cabinet (game and options to switch games)
Then we implement the button press to write "Breakout" to the screen. 
Then the canvas draws a simple breakout clone.
Then we update the breakout clone to include features.

Before we start, make sure to set up the project folder with the previously suggested directory structure.

1. Create the frontend.

    a. Begin by creating the `index.html` file with the provided structure, including the game container, game canvas, and game menu.
   
    b. Create a `main.css` file in the `css` folder to handle any necessary styling for the frontend, such as positioning and styling of the game container, game canvas, and game menu.

2. Implement basic game selection.

    a. Create a `main.js` file in the `js` folder.

    b. In the `main.js` file, include an array or object containing the list of available games and their respective file paths.

    c. Write a function that generates menu items for each game in the list, and appends them to the `gameMenu` element in the `index.html`.

    d. Add click event listeners to each menu item, which will load and start the selected game when clicked.

3. Implement the Breakout game.

    a. Create a `breakout.js` file in the `games` folder.

    b. Write the necessary classes and functions for the Breakout game, including a Game class, Ball class, Paddle class, and Brick class. These classes should handle the game's main logic, such as movement, collision detection, and rendering.

    c. Implement a game loop in the Breakout game that updates the game state, detects collisions, and renders objects on the canvas.

4. Integrate the Breakout game with the frontend.

    a. In the `main.js` file, write a function to dynamically load the selected game file using JavaScript (e.g., with `document.createElement("script")`).

    b. When a game is loaded, create a new instance of its Game class and start the game loop.

5. Add features to the Breakout game.

    a. Implement additional features like a scoring system, levels, and game over state.

    b. Add other game enhancement features like power-ups or additional challenges.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each additional game you want to include in the arcade cabinet.

Here's how the functions in the `main.js` should communicate with each other:

1. The `init` function should call the `generateMenu` function to create the menu items.

2. The `gameMenuItemClicked` function should be called when a menu item is clicked.

    a. `gameMenuItemClicked` should call the `loadGame` function and pass in the file path of the game that was clicked.

    b. The `loadGame` function should dynamically create a `<script>` tag and set its `src` attribute to the game's file path.

3. Once the game file is loaded, the `startGame` function, which is defined within the individual game files (e.g., `breakout.js`), should be called.

4. Each game file should define its own game loop and manage its own game state. Games should interact with the canvas and create instances of their required classes and objects.

By following these steps and maintaining proper communication between functions in the `main.js` file and individual game files, your arcade cabinet project should be well-structured and easily extensible.
