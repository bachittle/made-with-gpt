Document some changes I should make to the code to make the game of Qix functional.

1. Create a method to handle the drawing and updating of the player's trail lines.

2. Add logic to check when the player collides with its own trail lines and trigger a game over in that case.

3. Implement the game's scoring and area capturing mechanics. Track the total area captured by the player, and update the game progress accordingly. When the player returns to the edge of the screen, close off the polygon they've created and calculate the area of the "captured" territory.

4. Add logic to spawn multiple Qix objects as the game progresses and increase their speed or movement patterns for additional difficulty.

5. Implement a "Sparx" enemy that moves along the edge of the player's trail lines, adding another obstacle for the player to avoid.

6. Improve the game's user interface to display the current score, the percentage of the total area captured, and the remaining number of player lives.

7. Implement a detection for when the player has completed the game (i.e., reached a certain percentage of area captured), and display a win screen with the option to restart or quit.

8. Add error handling and input validation, such as checking that the canvas is not null or undefined.

9. Adjust the player's and Qix's movement to follow the game's specific movement rules, such as the player only being able to move vertically or horizontally, and the Qix moving diagonally within the bounds of unclaimed territory.

10. Consider adding more advanced features such as power-ups, different game modes or levels, or sound effects and music, to provide a more engaging gaming experience.
