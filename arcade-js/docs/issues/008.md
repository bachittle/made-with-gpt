the invaders all fly to the bottom right away and initiate a game over

how do I fix this?

It seems that the issue is caused by the `update()` method in the "shared/invader.js" file. Specifically, the conditional statements inside this function allow the invaders to move continually in the same direction and speed without any constraints. 

To fix the issue, you need to adjust the `update()` method in the "shared/invader.js" file as follows:

```javascript
update(canvas) {
  this.x += this.moveX;

  // When it hits the wall, it goes down and changes direction
  if (this.x + this.width > canvas.width || this.x < 0) {
    this.moveX = -this.moveX;
    this.y += this.height; // Move down by its height
  }
}
```

By adjusting the method like this, the invaders will move horizontally within the boundaries of the canvas, and they'll move down by their height when they hit a wall. This should prevent them from flying to the bottom right away and initiating a game over.
