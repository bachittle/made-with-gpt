The paddle is not moving for the pong game.

What is the issue? How can I fix it?

The issue seems to be in the `handleKeydown` and `handleKeyup` methods where you are modifying the `movingUp` and `movingDown` properties of the `Paddle` class. However, in the Paddle class, you are using the properties `movingLeft` and `movingRight`. That's why the paddles are not moving.

To fix this issue, you should change the properties of the Paddle class to `movingUp` and `movingDown` and update the code accordingly. Here is the modified Paddle class:

```javascript
// Paddle class
class Paddle {
  constructor(x, y, width, height) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.speed = 5;
    this.movingUp = false;
    this.movingDown = false;
  }

  moveUp() {
    this.y -= this.speed;
  }

  moveDown() {
    this.y += this.speed;
  }

  update(canvas) {
    if (this.movingUp) {
      this.moveUp();
    }
    if (this.movingDown) {
      this.moveDown();
    }

    if (this.y < 0) {
      this.y = 0;
    } else if (this.y + this.height > canvas.height) {
      this.y = canvas.height - this.height;
    }
  }

  draw(ctx) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.rect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
    ctx.fillStyle = "black";
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.closePath();
  }
}

export default Paddle;
```

Now, the paddle should move as expected in the pong game.

the ball is bouncing on the left and right wall but the score is not being updated. How can I fix this?

It seems like the issue is that you are not updating the score in the `update()` method of the `PongGame`. When the ball collides with either the left or the right wall, you should update the respective player's score. 

To fix this issue, update the score in the `update()` method of the `PongGame` class:

```javascript
update() {
  this.ball.update(this.canvas);
  this.leftPaddle.update(this.canvas);
  this.rightPaddle.update(this.canvas);

  this.checkBallCollision();

  if (this.ball.x + this.ball.radius <= 0) {
    this.scoreRight++;
    this.ball.reset(this.canvas.width / 2, this.canvas.height / 2);
  }

  if (this.ball.x - this.ball.radius >= this.canvas.width) {
    this.scoreLeft++;
    this.ball.reset(this.canvas.width / 2, this.canvas.height / 2);
  }
}
```

Now, the score should be updated correctly when the ball bounces off the left or right wall.

I already have this written. Are you sure that is the fix?

Apologies for my previous response. I misunderstood the issue. I see you have already implemented the score update in the `update()` method of the `PongGame` class.

Upon further examination, it appears that the score update code is placed after the `checkBallCollision()` method call. This causes the ball to bounce off the paddle in some scenarios, and the score is not updated correctly. To fix this issue, you can move the score update code before the `checkBallCollision()` method call in the `update()` method of the `PongGame` class:

```javascript
update() {
  this.ball.update(this.canvas);
  this.leftPaddle.update(this.canvas);
  this.rightPaddle.update(this.canvas);

  if (this.ball.x + this.ball.radius <= 0) {
    this.scoreRight++;
    this.ball.reset(this.canvas.width / 2, this.canvas.height / 2);
  }

  if (this.ball.x - this.ball.radius >= this.canvas.width) {
    this.scoreLeft++;
    this.ball.reset(this.canvas.width / 2, this.canvas.height / 2);
  }

  this.checkBallCollision();
}
```

This change should fix the issue, and the score should be updated correctly when the ball bounces off the left or right wall.

The issue is still not resolved. The ball is bouncing off the left and right walls but no score is being updated.
Could the issue perhaps be with the way the radius is added / subtracted?

Apologies for the confusion earlier. I took another look at your `update()` method and found that your current conditions for checking if the ball hits the left or right wall are not entirely correct. This is because you are taking the ball's radius into account for detecting a collision with the walls. Since you are only checking for collisions when the ball is beyond the canvas boundaries, there's no need to add or subtract the ball's radius. 

To fix the score update issue, simply remove the addition and subtraction of the ball's radius in the `update()` method of the `PongGame` class:

```javascript
update() {
  this.ball.update(this.canvas);
  this.leftPaddle.update(this.canvas);
  this.rightPaddle.update(this.canvas);

  if (this.ball.x <= 0) {
    this.scoreRight++;
    this.ball.reset(this.canvas.width / 2, this.canvas.height / 2);
  }

  if (this.ball.x >= this.canvas.width) {
    this.scoreLeft++;
    this.ball.reset(this.canvas.width / 2, this.canvas.height / 2);
  }

  this.checkBallCollision();
}
```

Now, the score should be updated correctly when the ball bounces off the left or right wall.

it was close, but the issue was never found...

the issue was: radius operations should have been flipped
