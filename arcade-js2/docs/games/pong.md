What other fixes and features should I add to the pong clone?

Here are some suggestions for additional fixes and features for your Pong clone:

1. Add smooth paddle movement: Currently, the paddle movement is based on the keydown and keyup events. Implement a smoother paddle movement using the `requestAnimationFrame()` method to make the game more enjoyable.
 
2. Ball speed variation: Add some slight random variation in the ball's initial speed and direction. This will add variety and unpredictability to the gameplay.

3. Ball speed increase: Gradually increase the ball's speed as the game progresses to make it more challenging over time.

4. Collision angle variation: Vary the angle of the ball's bounce off of the paddles based on the point of impact. This will make the gameplay more dynamic and interesting.

5. Power-ups: Implement various power-ups that appear during the game, like increasing paddle size, speeding up or slowing down the ball, etc., to enhance the gameplay and provide more excitement.

6. Sounds effects: Add sound effects for ball collisions with paddles, walls, and scoring to make the game more immersive.

7. Multiplayer option: Allow two players to control the paddles using either separate sets of keys or even separate devices (e.g., via websockets) for a more interactive experience.

8. AI opponent: Implement an AI-driven paddle on one side that can automatically track and respond to the ball's movement, so players can play alone against a computer opponent.

9. Scoring system improvements: Set a limit for the number of points needed to win the match and show a victory message when a player reaches the winning score.

10. Game menu: Add a menu at the beginning of the game allowing players to select options such as single-player or multiplayer, configure controls, and choose difficulty levels.
