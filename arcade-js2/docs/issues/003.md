the breakout canvas is stretched. How do I fix this?

You can fix the stretched canvas by setting the canvas dimensions explicitly in your `main.js` file. 

Modify the `loadGame` function in `main.js` as follows:

```javascript
// The loadGame function dynamically loads the selected game file and starts the game.
async function loadGame(gameFilePath) {
  const gameModule = await import(gameFilePath);
  const gameClass = gameModule.default;
  const canvas = document.getElementById("gameCanvas");
  
  // Set canvas dimensions explicitly
  canvas.width = 800;
  canvas.height = 600;
  
  const game = new gameClass(canvas);
  game.start();
}
```

This will set the canvas width and height explicitly to 800x600, which should prevent the canvas from getting stretched.
