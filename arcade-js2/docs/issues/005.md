I'm getting this error:

Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at BreakoutGame.createBricks (breakout.js:59:81)
    at new BreakoutGame (breakout.js:20:24)

how do i fix?

It looks like the error is caused by trying to access the `length` property of `this.powerUps` in the `createBricks` method, but `this.powerUps` is still undefined at that point. To fix this, you can move the `powerUps` array initialization after the `super()` call in the constructor, like this:

```javascript
constructor(canvas) {
  super(canvas);
  this.powerUps = [
    {color: "blue", action: this.widerPaddle},
    {color: "blue", action: this.narrowerPaddle},
    {color: "red", action: this.fasterBall},
    {color: "red", action: this.slowerBall},
    {color: "green", action: this.extraLife},
    {color: "yellow", action: this.multiBall},
  ];
  this.bricks = this.createBricks(5, 7);
  // ... rest of the constructor code
}
```

Also, notice that you are trying to invoke each power-up action inside the `displayPowerUpText` method, but you haven't bound the methods to the instance of the class. To fix this, bind them in the constructor:

```javascript
constructor(canvas) {
  super(canvas);
  this.widerPaddle = this.widerPaddle.bind(this);
  this.narrowerPaddle = this.narrowerPaddle.bind(this);
  this.fasterBall = this.fasterBall.bind(this);
  this.slowerBall = this.slowerBall.bind(this);
  this.extraLife = this.extraLife.bind(this);
  this.multiBall = this.multiBall.bind(this);
  this.powerUps = [
    {color: "blue", action: this.widerPaddle},
    {color: "blue", action: this.narrowerPaddle},
    {color: "red", action: this.fasterBall},
    {color: "red", action: this.slowerBall},
    {color: "green", action: this.extraLife},
    {color: "yellow", action: this.multiBall},
  ];
  this.bricks = this.createBricks(5, 7);
  // ... rest of the constructor code
}
```

This should fix the error and allow the game to run correctly with power-ups.

it now says: 'super' keyword unexpected here.

My apologies for the confusion. It seems I overlooked the fact that the `BreakoutGame` class is not inheriting from any other class, thus the `super()` call is not needed. Please remove the `super(canvas);` line from the constructor. The updated constructor should look like this:

```javascript
constructor(canvas) {
  this.canvas = canvas;
  this.ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  this.ball = new Ball(50, 50, 5);
  this.paddle = new Paddle(canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 10, 80, 10);
  this.widerPaddle = this.widerPaddle.bind(this);
  this.narrowerPaddle = this.narrowerPaddle.bind(this);
  this.fasterBall = this.fasterBall.bind(this);
  this.slowerBall = this.slowerBall.bind(this);
  this.extraLife = this.extraLife.bind(this);
  this.multiBall = this.multiBall.bind(this);
  this.powerUps = [
    {color: "blue", action: this.widerPaddle},
    {color: "blue", action: this.narrowerPaddle},
    {color: "red", action: this.fasterBall},
    {color: "red", action: this.slowerBall},
    {color: "green", action: this.extraLife},
    {color: "yellow", action: this.multiBall},
  ];
  this.bricks = this.createBricks(5, 7);
  // ... rest of the constructor code
}
```

This should resolve the error, and the game should run correctly with power-ups.
