The paddle is not moving for the pong game.

What is the issue? How can I fix it?

The issue seems to be in the `handleKeydown` and `handleKeyup` methods where you are modifying the `movingUp` and `movingDown` properties of the `Paddle` class. However, in the Paddle class, you are using the properties `movingLeft` and `movingRight`. That's why the paddles are not moving.

To fix this issue, you should change the properties of the Paddle class to `movingUp` and `movingDown` and update the code accordingly. Here is the modified Paddle class:

```javascript
// Paddle class
class Paddle {
  constructor(x, y, width, height) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.speed = 5;
    this.movingUp = false;
    this.movingDown = false;
  }

  moveUp() {
    this.y -= this.speed;
  }

  moveDown() {
    this.y += this.speed;
  }

  update(canvas) {
    if (this.movingUp) {
      this.moveUp();
    }
    if (this.movingDown) {
      this.moveDown();
    }

    if (this.y < 0) {
      this.y = 0;
    } else if (this.y + this.height > canvas.height) {
      this.y = canvas.height - this.height;
    }
  }

  draw(ctx) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.rect(this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);
    ctx.fillStyle = "black";
    ctx.fill();
    ctx.closePath();
  }
}

export default Paddle;
```

Now, the paddle should move as expected in the pong game.
